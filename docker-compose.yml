    # TODO: Use a minimal image instead. The alpine version
    # "klakegg/hugo:0.101.0-ext-alpine" complains:
    #
    #    fatal: unsafe repository ('/src' is owned by someone else)
    #
    # This is because Git 2.35.2 added this check as a security fix. The
    # non-minimal image has an older version of Git, so it doesn't complain.
    # Can be fixed with a .gitconfig containing:
    #
    #     [safe]
    #         directory = /home/repon
